# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of the Project
The task of this project was to determine how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the provided crowdfunding data with over 4000 entries, I then used Excel to create graphs to provide the necessary visualizations for the campaign outcomes based on the two key factors above: launch dates and funding goals. 

##	Analysis and Challenges
The first key factor focused on the outcomes of theater campaigns based on their launch dates. Looking at the graph below, we can see that the most successful theater campaigns started in May, but also had great success when launched between the months of April and August.  However, we also notice that the number of failed campaigns also peaked during those same months. The difference is that the number of successful campaigns had a much higher peak than the number of failed ones. We see the number of canceled campaigns is minimal and the same for almost every month,  so we could assume that launch date had little to no effect on that.

The second key factor analyzed the outcomes of the campaign (successful, failed, or cancelled) dependent on the range of the funding goal. As we can see from the graph below, we notice that the most successful campaigns where in the $45,000 t0 $50,000 range. However, there is no clear pattern of whether the campaign was successful or a failure. Another interesting thing that can be noticed, is that graphs are mirror images of each other. This is because it was calculated on percent of successful vs. failure, and there were no canceled campaigns in the data.

## Results
One conclusion that can be made from the launch dates, is that there are a higher number of campaigns, in general, that are launched between the months of April and August and a lower number of campaigns launched towards the end of the year. The biggest thing that is noticeable is the peak of the successful campaigns are in May and the lowest number of successful campaigns are between November and January. Therefore, I would suggest to launch a campaign around May or other warmer months and try to avoid it during the colder season. 

Referencing the outcomes based on goals, even through that we see the peak of successful campaigns in the range of $45k to $50k, we also notice that there isn’t a consistent pattern dependent on funding goal. Therefore, I would conclude that the funding goal amount doesn’t have a correlation of whether the campaign will be successful or not. 

Since we don’t see any clear indication from the two factors analyzed,  launch date and goal amount, of whether a campaign will be successful or not, I would suggest that the dataset is limited. I would also suggest that other factors be considered and more tables and graphs be analyzed to determine if there is any factor that can be contributed to a successful campaign.
